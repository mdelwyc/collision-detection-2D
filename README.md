# collision-detection-2D
My small library, which can detect collision in 2D between several shapes

Most of all collision detection algorithms I take from here: https://jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/

This library have next shapes: point, line, circle, triangle, rectangle and polygon

ICollision interface unite all this structures
